A Brief Overview of the Markup language (HTML) and the Style-sheet (CSS) employed for project:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and is used to create
the structure and content of web pages.
HTML uses tags to define elements such as headings, paragraphs,
links, images, and forms.

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and is used to define
the visual appearance of web pages.
CSS uses rules to specify properties such as colors, fonts,
sizes, and positions for HTML elements.
CSS allows the separation of the content and structure of a
web page from its presentation and layout.

HTML and CSS are linked together through a process called
"linking" or "importing."
HTML files can link to external CSS files using the <link>
element in the <head> section of the HTML document.
CSS files can also be included within the HTML document using
the <style> element in the <head> section or directly within
HTML elements using the style attribute.
By separating the content and structure from the presentation
and layout, web designers can easily make changes to the visual
appearance of a website without altering the HTML structure or
content.
HTML and CSS are the core technologies used to create most modern
websites and are essential skills for web developers and designers.
