An Overview of the AirBnB project:
----------------------------------

Unlike the main AirBnB web app that has so many features and interactivity, ours a clone of the
original will not be so elaborate, but will have a very lightly similar framework and frontend
as the original, although with highly reduced interactiveness and UI.
Our project will be built wholely with Python, HTML and CSS for styling unlike the original which
tools are listed below.


Airbnb is a web-based platform that allows people to rent out their homes or apartments to travelers.
The website has a complex web architecture that includes various components and technologies.
Here's a brief overview of the key elements of the Airbnb web architecture:

Client-side technologies: Airbnb's client-side architecture is built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
These technologies allow the website to deliver a rich user experience and enable interactive features
such as search filters, maps, and booking forms.

Front-end framework: Airbnb uses React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, as
its front-end framework. React allows developers to build reusable UI components and manage complex
state and data flows.

Server-side technologies: Airbnb's server-side architecture is based on a microservices approach,
which involves breaking down the application into small, independent services that communicate with
each other over APIs. Airbnb uses a combination of technologies, including Ruby on Rails, Node.js, and
Java, to build its backend services.

Data storage: Airbnb uses a combination of SQL and NoSQL databases to store and manage its data. The
website's main database is built on MySQL, which is used to store user information, listings, and
booking data. Airbnb also uses Apache Cassandra, a NoSQL database, for storing data related to search
and recommendations.

Cloud infrastructure: Airbnb runs its application on cloud infrastructure provided by Amazon Web
Services (AWS). This allows the website to scale its resources up or down as needed and ensures high
availability and reliability.

Content delivery: Airbnb uses a content delivery network (CDN) to deliver static assets such as images
and videos to users. This helps to speed up page load times and improve the overall user experience.

Overall, the web architecture of the Airbnb website is designed to deliver a highly interactive and
personalized experience to users while ensuring scalability, reliability, and security.
